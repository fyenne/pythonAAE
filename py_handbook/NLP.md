To learn NLP is not a hard task, it’s pretty much simple to learn just follow these steps you can definitely cover everything in NLP and crack any job interview, so without wasting too much time let’s get started.
we simply divide these steps into different levels like level 1,level2, and level3 so that you can easily understand. So let’s deep dive into the first level
Level 1: At this level, you can simply learn how NLP works, what are the different applications of NLP, how to use them so on. Then come to text preprocessing like how to do tokenization, lemmatization, how to remove stop word from a sentence.
After completing this coming to the next level
Level 2: In this level, we simply learn how to convert words into vectors so that our machine learning model can easily understand. you can learn some more techniques of text preprocessing like Bagofwords, TFIDF, Unigram, Bigram.
Coming to the advanced technique of level 2 you can also learn Gensim,word2vec, average word2vec.
After completing this you can simply solve some machine learning use case so that you have some strong carps on learning.
Now coming to the deep learning part you can implement NLP using deep learning also, so firstly you have a basic understanding of how a deep learning model is a work, basic knowledge of neural network, how hidden layer work, what is an optimizer, different type of optimizer, knowledge of gradient descent, how a loss function work, forward propagation backward propagation all these things.
Understanding of Artificial neural network is a must, then come to RNN, LSTM, GRU.
level 3: Now after learning all these things coming to this level, In this level, we simply learn word embedding, word2vec using some advanced deep learning technique, then jump to advance techniques like bidirectional LSTM RNN, Encoder, and Decoder, Attention model Transformer, Bert.
After completing this level solve some use cases using NLP deep learning
Then you are ready to face any interview and keep in mind learn in-depth because in an interview they ask you about the depth of every topic.
I hope this blog helps you to learn NLP in a much easier way
Good luck
